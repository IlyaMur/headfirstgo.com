## Chapter 2 - Conditionals and Loops

### Exercise 3: `for` Loops

Your goal was to modify a program so that it kept asking for more numbers to add until the user entered "n" when asked to continue.

Example output is below. Notice that the second time the user is asked "Add more?", they just hit Enter, but because they didn't type "n", the loop continues.

``` text
Enter a number: 1.1
Add more? [Y/n] y
Enter a number: 2.3
Add more? [Y/n]
Enter a number: 3.4
Add more? [Y/n] n
Sum is 6.8
```

Here's our solution to this problem. It consists of simply adding a `for` loop (with no init or post statements) around the sections that ask for a number to add and whether the user wants to continue.

{% highlight go %}
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)

	var sum float64
	more := "y"

    // Keep looping while "more" is not equal to "n" and
    // also not equal to "N". (That way, users can respond
    // in upper-case or lower-case.
	for more != "n" && more != "N" {
		fmt.Print("Enter a number: ")
		input, err := reader.ReadString('\n')
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
		input = strings.TrimSpace(input)
		number, err := strconv.ParseFloat(input, 64)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}

		sum += number

		fmt.Print("Add more? [Y/n] ")
		more, err = reader.ReadString('\n')
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
		more = strings.TrimSpace(more)
	} // End of the loop.

	fmt.Println("Sum is", sum)
}
{% endhighlight %}
