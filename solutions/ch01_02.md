## Chapter 1 - Syntax Basics

### Exercise 2: Code Rework

### Solution

We've added comments to the code describing the changes we made.

{% highlight go %}
package main

// Since we're only importing one package, we can use the
// single-line format for "import".
import "fmt"

func main() {
	// We can use short variable declarations for everything.
	// Later words in multi-word variable names should be
	// capitalized.
	pebbleWeight := 0.1
	rockWeight := 1.2
	boulderWeight := 502.4
	// Underscores are legal in variable names, but are not
	// conventional.
	// Take the underscore out and capitalize the second word.
	totalWeight := pebbleWeight + rockWeight + boulderWeight
	fmt.Println(totalWeight)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Output:

``` text
503.7
```
