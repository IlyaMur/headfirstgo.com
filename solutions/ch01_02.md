### Exercise 2: Code Rework

Several of the variable names used in this example break Go naming conventions. The code is also somewhat longer than it needs to be. See if you can modify this code so that it produces the same output, but is shorter and follows conventions better.

{% highlight go %}
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var pebbleweight float64 = 0.1
	var rockweight float64 = 1.2
	var boulderweight float64 = 502.4
	var total_weight float64 = pebbleweight + rockweight + boulderweight
	fmt.Println(total_weight)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Output:

``` text
503.7
```

### Solution

We've added comments to the code describing the changes we made.

{% highlight go %}
package main

// Since we're only importing one package, we can use the
// single-line format for "import".
import "fmt"

func main() {
	// We can use short variable declarations for everything.
	// Later words in multi-word variable names should be
	// capitalized.
	pebbleWeight := 0.1
	rockWeight := 1.2
	boulderWeight := 502.4
	// Underscores are legal in variable names, but are not
	// conventional.
	// Take the underscore out and capitalize the second word.
	totalWeight := pebbleWeight + rockWeight + boulderWeight
	fmt.Println(totalWeight)
}
{% endhighlight %}
