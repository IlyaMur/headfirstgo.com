## Chapter 7 - Maps

### Exercise 1: Counting Occurrences of Strings

In the chapter 5 exercises, we asked you to count how many times the numbers 0, 1, and 2 occurred within an array. This time, your task is to count how many times letters occur within a slice.

*Hint: You can set up a map with strings as its keys and integers as its values. The values can be used to keep track of the number of times each key string has occurred.*

### Solution

{% highlight go %}
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// We'll count the number of times each letter occurs
	// within this slice.
	letters := []string{"b", "a", "c", "a", "b", "a",
		"a", "b", "c"}
	// YOUR CODE HERE: Process each element of "letters",
	// keeping track of how many times you've seen "a",
	// "b", or "c".
	// "occurrences" will have the keys "a", "b", and "c".
	// The values will be the number of times that letter
	// has occurred.
	occurrences := make(map[string]int)
	// Process each element in "letters". We ignore the
	// index because we don't need it.
	for _, letter := range letters {
		// The zero value for values in "occurrences"
		// is 0. So we can safely increment it even if
		// we've never assigned to it.
		occurrences[letter]++
	}
	// Finally, print out the number of times each letter
	// occurred.
	for letter, count := range occurrences {
		fmt.Println(letter, "occurred", count, "times")
	}
}
