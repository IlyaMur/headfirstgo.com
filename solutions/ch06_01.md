## Chapter 6 - Slices

### Exercise 1: The Slice Operator

Define a `printLines` function that takes a slice of strings as a parameter, and prints each element of that slice on a separate line.

Then, in `main`, get a slice of the `daysOfWeek` array containing just the weekdays: "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", and "Friday". Pass that slice to `printLines`.

### Solution

{% highlight go %}
package main

import "fmt"

// YOUR CODE HERE: Define a printLines function.
func printLines(lines []string) {
	for _, line := range lines {
		fmt.Println(line)
	}
}

func main() {
	daysOfWeek := [7]string{"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday",
		"Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"}
	// YOUR CODE HERE: Get a slice containing just the
	// weekdays.
	weekdays := daysOfWeek[1:6]
	// Pass that slice to printLines.
	printLines(weekdays)
}
{% endhighlight %}
