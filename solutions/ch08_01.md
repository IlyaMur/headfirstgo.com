## Chapter 8 - Structs

### Exercise 1: Defined Types and Structs

Let's create a struct type named `rectangle`, that represents rectangular areas. It should have `length` and `width` fields, both of type `float64`.

Also create a `rectangleInfo` function that accepts a `rectangle` as a parameter. `rectangleInfo` should print `"Length:"` followed by the rectangle's length, then `"Width:"` followed by the rectangle's width.

Finally, in your `main` function, create a new `rectangle` value, and set its `length` and `width` fields. Then pass the `rectangle` to `rectangleInfo` to display its field values.

### Solution

{% highlight go %}
package main

import "fmt"

// YOUR CODE HERE: Declare a "rectangle" struct type.
type rectangle struct {
	length float64
	width  float64
}

// YOUR CODE HERE: Define a rectangleInfo function.
func rectangleInfo(r rectangle) {
	fmt.Println("Length:", r.length)
	fmt.Println("Width:", r.width)
}

func main() {
	// YOUR CODE HERE: Create a new rectangle, and set
	// its length and width fields. Pass it to rectangleInfo.
	var r rectangle
	r.length = 4.2
	r.width = 2.3
	rectangleInfo(r)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Sample output:

``` text
Length: 4.2
Width: 2.3
```
