### Exercise 2: Calling Methods

The `strings` package has a `Builder` type that is used to build a long text string out of multiple shorter ones.

Complete the code sample below. The sample contains comments in several places indicating what the code you add should do.

### Solution

{% highlight go %}
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	// The "builder" variable holds a "strings.Builder"
	// value. We're not assigning a value to "builder",
	// but that's okay; you can call methods on the
	// zero value for the "strings.Builder" type.
	var builder strings.Builder
	
	// YOUR CODE HERE: Call the "WriteRune" method on
	// "builder" 3 times, with the runes 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
	builder.WriteRune('a')
	builder.WriteRune('b')
	builder.WriteRune('c')
	
	// YOUR CODE HERE: Call the "WriteString" method on
	// "builder" once, with the string "defg".
	builder.WriteString("defg")
	
	// YOUR CODE HERE: Call the "String" method on
	// "builder", and pass the result to "fmt.Println".
	fmt.Println(builder.String())
}
{% endhighlight %}

Output:

``` text
abcdefg
```
