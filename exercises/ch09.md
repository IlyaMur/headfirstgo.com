## Chapter 9 - Defined Types

### Exercise 1: Defining Methods

In the last chapter's exercises, we had you write a `rectangleInfo` function that accepted a `rectangle` struct value and printed its `length` and `width` fields. Convert the `rectangleInfo` function into an `info` method on the `rectangle` type.

{% highlight go %}
package main

import "fmt"

type rectangle struct {
	length float64
	width  float64
}

// YOUR CODE HERE: Convert this function to a method on
// the "rectangle" type named "info".
func rectangleInfo(r rectangle) {
	fmt.Println("Length:", r.length)
	fmt.Println("Width:", r.width)
}

func main() {
	var r rectangle
	r.length = 4.2
	r.width = 2.3
	// YOUR CODE HERE: Update this function call to a
	// method call.
	rectangleInfo(r)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Output:

``` text
Length: 4.2
Width: 2.3
```

When you're ready, have a look at [our solution](/solutions/ch09_01.html).

### Exercise 2: Pointer Receivers for Methods

Now see if you can convert last chapter's `makeSquare` function to a method on the `rectangle` type. (That is, calling the `makeSquare` method on a `rectangle` value should convert that `rectangle` to a square.)

Because `makeSquare` needs to modify its receiver, be sure the receiver parameter has a pointer type. And because both the `makeSquare` and `info` methods are on the same type, it would be a good idea to convert `info` to a pointer receiver as well.

### Solution

{% highlight go %}
// Convert this function to a method on the "rectangle" type.
func makeSquare(r *rectangle) {
	if r.length > r.width {
		r.length = r.width
	} else {
		r.width = r.length
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's [our solution](/solutions/ch09_02.html).
