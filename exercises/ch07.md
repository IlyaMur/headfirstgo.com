### Exercise 1: Counting Occurrences of Strings

In the chapter 5 exercises, we asked you to count how many times the numbers 0, 1, and 2 occurred within an array. This time, your task is to count how many times letters occur within a slice.

*Hint: You can set up a map with strings as its keys and integers as its values. The values can be used to keep track of the number of times each key string has occurred.*

### Solution

{% highlight go %}
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// We'll count the number of times each letter occurs
	// within this slice.
	letters := []string{"b", "a", "c", "a", "b", "a",
		"a", "b", "c"}
	// YOUR CODE HERE: Process each element of "letters",
	// keeping track of how many times you've seen "a",
	// "b", or "c".
	// Finally, print out the number of times each letter
	// occurred.
}
{% endhighlight %}
