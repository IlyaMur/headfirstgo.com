## Chapter 4 - Packages

### Exercise 1: Importing Packages

We've set up a Go package at [`https://github.com/jaymcgavren/car`](https://github.com/jaymcgavren/car).

What command would you run in your terminal to download and install this package in your Go workspace?

``` text
$ 
```

Once you've installed the package, you'll have the following files in your workspace:

*`go/src/github.com/jaymcgavren/car/car.go`*

{% highlight go %}
package car

import "fmt"

func openDoor() {
        fmt.Println("Opening door")
}
{% endhighlight %}

*`go/src/github.com/jaymcgavren/car/headlights/headlights.go`*

{% highlight go %}
package headlights

import "fmt"

func TurnOn() {
        fmt.Println("Shining headlights")
}
{% endhighlight %}

*`go/src/github.com/jaymcgavren/car/stereo/amplifier.go`*

{% highlight go %}
package stereo

import "fmt"

func TurnOn() {
        fmt.Println("Playing music")
}
{% endhighlight %}

*`go/src/github.com/jaymcgavren/car/stereo/speakers.go`*

{% highlight go %}
package stereo

import "fmt"

func BoostBass() {
        fmt.Println("Bwomp bwamp BWOOOOMP")
}
{% endhighlight %}

*`go/src/github.com/jaymcgavren/car/wheels/wheels.go`*

{% highlight go %}
package wheels

import "fmt"

func Accelerate() {
        fmt.Println("Peeling out!")
}

func Steer() {
        fmt.Println("Turning front wheels")
}
{% endhighlight %}

Write a program that imports all the above packages and calls all the functions they contain. You can include the program in your Go workspace, if you like, or just store it anywhere and run it with `go run`.

The program output should look like this:

``` text
Opening door
Shining headlights
Playing music
Bwomp bwamp BWOOOOMP
Turning front wheels
Peeling out!
```

When you're ready, have a look at [the solution](/solutions/ch04_01.html).
