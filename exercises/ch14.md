## Chapter 14 - Automated Testing

### Exercise 1: Testing a Package

Here is code for an `ordinals` package, with an `Ordinal` function that converts the integer `1` to the string `1st`, `2` to `2nd`, and so on. We have intentionally left out the code that converts `3` to `3rd`, so that we have a case where tests should fail.

You can either create this file manually, or install it automatically with:

``` text
$ go get github.com/jaymcgavren/ordinals
```

`$GOPATH/src/github.com/jaymcgavren/ordinals/ordinals.go`

{% highlight go %}
// Package ordinals converts integers to ordinal numbers.
// 1: 1st, 2: 2nd, and so on.
package ordinals

import "fmt"

// Ordinal accepts an integer and returns a string with
// that integer's ordinal form.
func Ordinal(number int) string {
	lastDigit := number % 10
	isInTeens := (number%100)/10 == 1
	if isInTeens {
		return fmt.Sprintf("%dth", number)
	} else if lastDigit == 1 {
		return fmt.Sprintf("%dst", number)
	} else if lastDigit == 2 {
		return fmt.Sprintf("%dnd", number)
	} else {
		return fmt.Sprintf("%dth", number)
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

Your goal is to create automated tests with the following expectations:

| Ordinal Parameter | Expected Return Value |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| `1` | `"1st"` |
| `2` | `"2nd"` |
| `3` | `"3rd"` (this test should fail) |
| `4` | `"4th"` |
| `11` | `"11th"` |
| `21` | `"21st"` |

&nbsp;

For now, you can use a failure message of `"didn't match expected value"` for every test.

Output:

``` text
--- FAIL: TestThree (0.00s)
	ordinals_test.go:19: didn't match expected value
FAIL
FAIL	github.com/jaymcgavren/ordinals	0.006s
```

When you're ready, have a look at [our solution](/solutions/ch14_01.html).

### Exercise 2: Test Helper Methods

Write a helper function for your tests that accepts these parameters:

* The argument passed to `Ordinal`.
* The actual return value from `Ordinal`.
* The expected return value.

It should return a string in this format (without square brackets):

``` text
Ordinal([input]) = "[actual]", want "[expected]"
```

Update your tests for the calls `Ordinal(1)`, `Ordinal(2)`, and `Ordinal(3)` to use this helper function.

Output:

``` text
--- FAIL: TestThree (0.00s)
	ordinals_test.go:31: Ordinal(3) = "3th", want "3rd"
FAIL
FAIL	github.com/jaymcgavren/ordinals	0.007s
```
