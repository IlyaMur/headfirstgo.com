## Chapter 10 - Encapsulation and Embedding

### Exercise 1: Encapsulation

It shouldn't be possible, but users of our `rectangle` type are setting its `length` and `width` fields to negative values. We need to encapsulate these fields and add getter and setter methods to control access to them.

Update the `rectangle` type so that the program below will compile, run, and produce the output shown.

* Move the `rectangle` type and all its existing methods to a new `shapes` package.
* You'll need to rename the type and its existing methods so they're exported from the new package.
* Leave the struct fields _unexported_, however, so they can only be accessed through your getter and setter methods.
* The setter methods should return a single `error` value. If any value less than `0` is passed, return an error value indicating the value is invalid. Otherwise, return `nil`.

{% highlight go %}
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"shapes"
)

// check logs an error and exits if the error is not nil.
func check(err error) {
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

func main() {
	var r shapes.Rectangle
	err := r.SetLength(4.2)
	check(err)
	fmt.Println("Length:", r.Length())
	// Set width to an invalid value.
	err = r.SetWidth(-2.3)
	check(err)
	fmt.Println("Width:", r.Width())
}
{% endhighlight %}

Output:

``` text
Length: 4.2
2019/05/31 18:46:50 invalid width: -2.300000
exit status 1
```
