## Chapter 5 - Functions

### Exercise 1: Accessing Arrays

Create an array with 5 `string` elements, holding English weekday names: "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday". Then print each array element along with its index.

Expected output:

``` text
0 Monday
1 Tuesday
2 Wednesday
3 Thursday
4 Friday
```

You can assign array elements individually, or you can use an array literal. You can access the elements individually, use a `for` loop to get each element index, or use a `for ... range` loop to loop over the elements themselves. Better yet, try *all* these techniques! We'll show you several solutions incorporating several ways to solve this problem.

When you're ready, have a look at [the solutions](/solutions/ch05_01.html).

### Exercise 2: Counting Occurrences

We've set up a small array that contains the numbers 0, 1, and 2, each repeated a random number of times. Update the program to count how many times each number occurs.

*Hint: You can set up a second array to keep track of the number of occurrences. A three-element array will (conveniently) have the indexes 0, 1, and 2...*

{% highlight go %}
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// We'll count the number of times each number occurs
	// within this array.
	numbers := [9]int{1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2}
	// YOUR CODE HERE: Process each element of "numbers",
	// keeping track of how many times you've seen 0, 1,
	// or 2.
	// Finally, print out how many times each number
	// occurred.
}
{% endhighlight %}

Output:

``` text
0 occurred 4 times
1 occurred 3 times
2 occurred 2 times
```

<!-- You can try this on the [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/p/T81IYPh-Avt). -->

**Extra credit:** Now do the same for *this* array!

{% highlight go %}
	numbers := [100]int{4, 2, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1, 8, 7, 8,
		1, 5, 3, 2, 2, 1, 9, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 6,
		2, 2, 4, 7, 9, 6, 5, 9, 0, 5, 1, 1, 5, 4, 7,
		7, 9, 7, 8, 6, 3, 3, 3, 4, 8, 0, 4, 1, 1, 7,
		9, 8, 8, 1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 9, 2, 5, 8, 6, 7, 7,
		5, 4, 2, 9, 4, 4, 2, 2, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 1,
		9, 5, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 5, 3, 8, 6, 3, 4, 4, 9}
{% endhighlight %}
