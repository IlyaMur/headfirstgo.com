## Chapter 8 - Structs

### Exercise 1: Defined Types and Structs

Let's create a struct type named `rectangle`, that represents rectangular areas. It should have `length` and `width` fields, both of type `float64`.

Also create a `rectangleInfo` function that accepts a `rectangle` as a parameter. `rectangleInfo` should print `"Length:"` followed by the rectangle's length, then `"Width:"` followed by the rectangle's width.

Finally, in your `main` function, create a new `rectangle` value, and set its `length` and `width` fields. Then pass the `rectangle` to `rectangleInfo` to display its field values.

{% highlight go %}
package main

import "fmt"

// YOUR CODE HERE: Declare a "rectangle" struct type.

// YOUR CODE HERE: Define a rectangleInfo function.

func main() {
	// YOUR CODE HERE: Create a new rectangle, and set its
	// length and width fields. Pass it to rectangleInfo.
}
{% endhighlight %}

Sample output:

``` text
Length: 4.2
Width: 2.3
```

Here's [our solution](/solutions/ch08_01.html).
